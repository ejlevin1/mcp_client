## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added — headers that are fetched, not fixed

`StreamableHttpTransportConfig.headers` is set when the transport is built and spread onto every request unchanged. Anything that expires cannot live there: a host holding a short-lived attestation or session credential has no way to attach it, because by the time a request goes out the value it captured is stale.

`headersProvider` is asked on **every** outbound request — POST, the SSE GET stream, and the session-terminating DELETE — and receives `(url, method)` so one provider can serve several transports and decide per destination. `RequestHeadersProvider` and `reservedHeaderNames` are exported with the transport.

Three properties make it safe to hand to host code, including a page script:

- **It cannot break the exchange.** Names the protocol owns (`Content-Type`, `Accept`, `MCP-Session-Id`, `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name`, `Last-Event-ID`) are dropped rather than honoured, matched case-insensitively. A supplied `MCP-Session-Id` would otherwise fail the exchange in a way that reads as the server's fault.
- **It cannot cost a request.** A provider that throws, or exceeds `headersProviderTimeout` (5s default), contributes nothing and the request goes without it. Failing the request instead would report a hook problem as an unreachable server. What the origin then says about the missing credential is the accurate answer, and it comes from the origin.
- **Its failure is visible.** `lastHeadersProviderError` records the last one, because "the origin refused us" and "we never attached what the origin wanted" look identical on the wire and send a debugger to different places.

Explicitly configured `headers` win over supplied ones: a host that set a value meant it, and the provider is the general case yielding to the specific one.

Additive — no existing name or signature changed, and a transport with no provider behaves exactly as before. Ten regressions assert against a real socket, since the header map is assembled inside the transport and a mocked client would only be checking our own arrangement. Both guards mutation-checked.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-07-29 - Platform-conditional transports + specification conformance

Two cuts. The transport split changes behavior only on platforms without
`dart:io` — the STDIO and legacy SSE implementations are the same code, moved to
the native branch of a conditional export. The conformance work adds methods and
makes the protocol revision selectable; it removes nothing.

### Added — methods the protocol defines that this client could not send

Found by running this client against the official reference server: the calls
simply did not exist on `Client`.

- `ping()` — and an inbound `ping` is now answered with an empty result. The
  server side already handled `ping`; the client neither sent nor answered one,
  so a server keepalive got `Method not found` back.
- `complete(ref, argument, {context})` for `completion/complete`.

### Changed — the protocol revision is chosen per client

`Client.protocolVersion` was `final`, fixed at build time. A client could not
speak a revision a peer offered, and could not be exercised against more than
one. It is now a constructor parameter, carried through `McpClientConfig`,
`McpClient.createClient` and `copyWith`, defaulting to this build's default
version.

### Added — required request headers on revision `2026-07-28`

The Streamable HTTP transport mirrors `Mcp-Method`, and for the operations that
name a target `Mcp-Name`, into headers on the stateless path, using the
specification's base64 sentinel when a value cannot be carried as plain ASCII.
The values are derived from the body, never assumed: a mirror that disagrees
with the body is a rejectable mismatch.

### Changed
- `ClientTransport` moved to `src/transport/client_transport.dart` so both
  platform branches implement one type. `src/transport/transport.dart` is now a
  barrel that resolves `StdioClientTransport` and `SseClientTransport` per
  platform.
- The auth / compressed / heartbeat SSE variants resolve through
  `src/transport/legacy_sse.dart` instead of being exported individually.
  `mcp_client.dart` exports the barrel; the class names it re-exports are
  unchanged.

### Fixed
- On platforms without `dart:io`, constructing a transport that requires it now
  fails with an explicit `McpError` naming the unsupported transport and
  pointing at `StreamableHttpClientTransport`, instead of surfacing an opaque
  platform error from deep inside the implementation. An unavailable capability
  is reported, never silently substituted.
- `example/mcp_client_example_2.dart` — non-English log strings replaced with
  English.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-19 - 2025-11-25 conformance + 2026-07-28 stateless core (dormant)

Additive, backward-compatible (all new fields optional/named; `==`/`hashCode`
unchanged; behavior changes are negotiated-version gated). No public API removed.

### Added — 2025-11-25 conformance
- `ResourceTemplate.icons` (was dropped on resource templates).
- Sampling tool-calling: `CreateMessageRequest.tools` / `toolChoice`
  (`SamplingToolChoice` builders) + `CreateMessageResult.toolCalls` (SEP-1577).
- Typed elicitation layer (`elicitation.dart`): `EnumSchema` (titled/untitled
  `enumNames`), single- and multi-select enums (SEP-1330), URL-mode elicitation
  (SEP-1036), primitive default values (SEP-1034); raw-map path preserved.
- `Implementation.description` on `ClientInfo` / `ServerInfo`.
- JSON Schema 2020-12 default dialect helper (SEP-1613).
- OAuth: PRM discovery (RFC 9728, `WwwAuthenticateChallenge.parse` +
  `discoverFrom401`), OIDC Discovery 1.0 (PR#797), Client ID Metadata Documents
  (SEP-991, `OAuthConfig.clientIdMetadataUrl`), incremental scope step-up (SEP-835).

### Deprecated
- `CallToolResult.isStreaming` — non-standard hint, honored nowhere. Standard
  streaming = enable via a tool (`tools/call`) + deliver via a reactive resource
  (`Client.listen`/`subscriptions/listen`, or legacy `subscribeResource`).
  Retained + serialized for backward compatibility; removed in 3.0.

### Added — 2026-07-28 stateless core (BUILD-DORMANT, opt-in via `connect(statelessMode: true)`, default off)
- `_meta` reverse-DNS keys (`McpRequestMeta`), `server/discover` (`Client.discover()`),
  Multi-Round-Trip (`InputRequiredResult`), `subscriptions/listen` (`Client.listen`),
  Extensions framework (`ClientCapabilities.extensions`), Tasks extension
  (`getTask` / `updateTask` / `cancelTask`), RFC 9207 `iss` validation.
- Inert until opted in — zero behavior change for existing consumers.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-13 - Spec-optional description parsing

### Fixed
- `Tool` / `Resource` / `ResourceTemplate` `.fromJson` no longer require
  `description` (optional per the MCP spec; missing → `''`). A server omitting
  it made `tools/list` / `resources/list` parsing throw a `Null` cast.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-30 - MCP spec compliance + 2025-11-25 alignment

Big-Bang spec normalization. Supports protocol revisions 2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18, and 2025-11-25 with per-version capability gating. Pairs with mcp_server 2.0.

### Breaking
- **Sampling direction fixed.** `client.createMessage(...)` (which sent a request to the server) is removed. Sampling is server-initiated per spec — register a handler with `client.onSamplingRequest((req) async { ... })` so the host LLM fulfils it.
- **Roots direction fixed.** `client.listRoots()` (which sent a request to the server) is removed. The server requests roots from the client; configure them locally with `client.addRoot(...)` / `client.removeRoot(...)` and read via `client.roots`. Override the default response handler with `client.onListRoots(...)`. `roots/add` and `roots/remove` JSON-RPC methods (non-spec) are deleted.
- **Cancellation is now a notification.** `client.cancelOperation(opId)` (which sent a `cancel` request) is removed; use `client.notifyCancelled(requestId, reason: ...)` which emits the spec `notifications/cancelled` notification.
- **Logging method name corrected.** `setLoggingLevel` now sends `logging/setLevel` (camelCase) per spec — was `logging/set_level`.
- **`client.healthCheck()` removed** — `health/check` is non-spec; expose health via your transport (e.g. an HTTP `/health` endpoint).
- **`onSamplingResponse` listener removed** — the non-spec `sampling/response` notification path is gone, replaced by the standard request/response shape.

### Added
- `client.onSamplingRequest(handler)` — register a host LLM completion handler.
- `client.onElicitationRequest(handler)` — register a user-input handler (spec 2025-06-18 `elicitation/create`).
- `client.onListRoots(handler)` — override the default `roots/list` response.
- `client.notifyCancelled(requestId, {reason})` and `client.notifyProgress(token, progress, {total, message})` — spec notifications.
- `ClientCapabilities.elicitation` flag.
- `McpProtocol.v2025_06_18` and `McpProtocol.v2025_11_25` constants. `defaultVersion` advances to `v2025_11_25`.
- Per-version capability gates: `McpProtocol.supportsBatching` / `supportsElicitation` / `requiresProtocolHeader`.
- Schema: `Tool.title` / `Tool.outputSchema` / `Tool.icons` / `Tool.meta`. `CallToolResult.structuredContent`. `AudioContent`. `ResourceLinkContent`.
- Incoming-request infrastructure routes server-initiated requests to registered handlers and returns a JSON-RPC response with the matching id.
